CURRENT PROGRESS:

Design an app that locates the user location and store the location as lattitude and longtitude in a cloud database. 

Picture 1: user types their name in and hit the 'Share Location' button <img width="453" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-05 at 7 35 21 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96477325/200120368-c915517c-92fc-4642-93d5-b38ef89fe7c9.png">

Picture 2: our app will locate the user location (constantly update the location).

Picture 3: the location is saved as a form containing 3 main components:
1/ user name.
2/ lattitude.
3/ longtitude.

UPCOMING STEPS: <br />
1/ Need to work on multiple users can see the app. <br />
2/ Test the apps on real devices. <br />
3/ Write unit test to test the codes in different scenarios. <br />
